# arma-3-WRP_Calculator

Basic calculator for ArmA 3 terrain specifications, includes preset terrain sizes drop down to ease the process.

Over the years since arma1 I have been using [XYZ Creator](https://github.com/SnakeManPMC/arma-2-XYZ_Creator) to quickly check some terrain specifications for example when planning on new terrain etc. WRP Calculator is a remake of that tool with all the latest specifications we can or must use.

2018-07-29 with ArmA 3 v1.82 we clip the maximum recommended satellite resolution in pixels to 163,840 because that is the largest we have gotten successfully in-game.

This tool should be a web page instead, but yeah who doesnt love some C++ heh.
